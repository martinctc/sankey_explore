# sankey_explore
Explore the different ways of creating sankey and alluvial diagrams in R

## Background
This was originally an attempt in 2018 to explore all the different ways of creating sankey and alluvial plots in R. At the time when I started this project, I didn't have a very structured workflow. I've decided to pick this back up at the beginning of 2020 to make this project 'share-able' and into something that can benefit other users and R learners.
